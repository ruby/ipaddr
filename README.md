# IPAddr

IPAddr provides a set of methods to manipulate an IP address.  Both
IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

[![build](https://github.com/ruby/ipaddr/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ruby/ipaddr/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Installation

This library is part of the standard ruby distribution as default gem
and synchronized periodically, but you can explicitly depend on this
gem with version constraints as necessary, like when you need a newer
version than comes with older versions of ruby.

For example, you can add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ipaddr', '~> 1.2'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ipaddr

## Usage

```ruby
require 'ipaddr'

ipaddr1 = IPAddr.new "3ffe:505:2::1"

p ipaddr1                   #=> #<IPAddr: IPv6:3ffe:0505:0002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff>

p ipaddr1.to_s              #=> "3ffe:505:2::1"

ipaddr2 = ipaddr1.mask(48)  #=> #<IPAddr: IPv6:3ffe:0505:0002:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/ffff:ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000>

p ipaddr2.to_s              #=> "3ffe:505:2::"

ipaddr3 = IPAddr.new "192.168.2.0/24"

p ipaddr3                   #=> #<IPAddr: IPv4:192.168.2.0/255.255.255.0>
```

## Alternative

The [ipaddress](https://rubygems.org/gems/ipaddress) gem is a popular,
extensive library for manipulating IP addresses with a layer of
compatibility with `ipaddr`.  If you need a richer set of features
than `ipaddr` has, try this library instead.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
